## Getting Started

To get started with Java Forge, you'll need to have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your computer. You can download the latest version of JDK from the official website at [https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html).

Once you have JDK installed, clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/legitShivam/java-forge.git
```

Alternatively, you can download the repository as a ZIP file and extract it to your desired location.

## Algorithms

The `algorithms` folder contains implementation of various algorithms in Java. Each algorithm is implemented in a separate file with a brief explanation of the algorithm and how it works.

We have also included some exercises for each algorithm to help you practice and reinforce your understanding of the algorithms.

## Data Structures

The `data-structures` folder contains implementation of various data structures in Java. Each data structure is implemented in a separate file with a brief explanation of the data structure and its use cases.

## Applied Mathematics

the appliedmathematics folder contains python code that implements various mathematical concepts and equations. these files cover a range of topics, including linear algebra, calculus, probability, and more.

## Amity Java Programming

The `amity-java-programming` folder contains source code for various projects that are part of the Amity Java Programming course. These projects are designed to help you apply the concepts learned in the course to real-world scenarios.

### Playground

The `playground` directory is where I experiment with new Python concepts and ideas. It contains a `Play.java` file which is untracked in git so feel free to explore and experiment in this directory.

> To omit the changes to `Play.java` run the following command

``` Bash
git update-index --assume-unchanged ./playground/Play.java
```

# Snippets

The `snippets` folder contains small code snippets that demonstrate various concepts in Java programming. These snippets are designed to be concise and easy to understand.
